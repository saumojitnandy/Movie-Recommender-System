# Movie-Recommender-System
A movie recommendation system in Python is a program that suggests movies to users based on their preferences, past viewing history, or similarity to other users' tastes. It typically involves techniques like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches. These systems analyze large datasets of movies and user interactions to generate personalized recommendations. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn are commonly used for data processing and machine learning algorithms. The system can be deployed as a standalone application, integrated into streaming platforms, or used in e-commerce websites to enhance user experience and engagement.

Project Requirements:
1. Python < 3.10
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Scikit-Learn
5. NLTK
